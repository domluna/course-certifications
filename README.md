course-certifications
---------------------

Course certifications in courses I've taken from and completed from Coursera, edX and Udacity.

## Highlights from the Escapades

* Google Car Robitics Class: Localization, Karman/Particle Filters, A-Star, PID Control, SLAM
* BerkeleyX:Implemented search algorithms like alpha-beta pruning and using Reinforcement Learning, Markov Decision Processes to make Pacman a monster
* NLP: Machine Translation using IBM Models 1 & 2. Trained a probabilistic context-free grammar for parsing. Viterbi algorithm for tagging
* Solved lots of awesome problems in Peter Norvig's Program Design class
* Learned about caching techniques to avoid DB lookups (Memcache for GAE)
* Implemented all the algorithms in Andrew Ng's Coursera class: Linear/Logistic Regression, Neural Networks, SVD, Anomaly Detection, Clustering, Collaborative Filtering
* Learned about practical machine learning techniques such as how to avoid Overfitting and Underfitting: L1/L2 Regularization, Cross Validation
* MITx Data Analytics: Learned a ton about how data science actually works. The importance of sensitivity and specificity, depending on the task one might be far more severe than the other
* Learned about tradeoffs of model prediction vs. model understandibility (ex. Logistic Regression is really understandable (co-effs) vs. Random Forest)
